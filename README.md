### Bolt Installer for Composer

To start the install just run the following command replacing the project with
the name you want to use.

`composer create-project bolt/composer-install:^3.3@beta <MYPROJECT> --prefer-dist`


After the packages have downloaded, you can choose whether you would like a
separate public directory and if so choose a name.
